    "3. Write a function called rotate_tuple that takes two arguments: a tuple and an integer, in that order. Letting n be the integer given in the input, your function should return a tuple of the same length as the input tuple, but with its entries “rotated” by n. \n",
    "\n",
    "    If n is positive, this should mean to “push forward” all the entries of the input tuple by n entries, with entries that “go off the end” of the tuple being wrapped around to the beginning, so that the i-th entry of the input tuple becomes the (i + n)-th entry of the output, wrapping around to the beginning of the tuple if this index goes off the end. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    If n is negative, then this corresponds to rotating the entries in the other direction, with entries of the input tuple being “pushed backward”. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Your function should perform error checking to ensure that the inputs are of appropriate types. If the user supplies a non-integer, print a message to alert the user that the input was not as expected, and try to recover by casting it to an integer. \n",
